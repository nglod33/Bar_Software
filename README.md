# Bar_Software

This is bar management software written for RIT's beverage fermentation and distillation class. The idea is to have an application that scans a person's ID and 
validates if they are of age or not. This app will also store the record of the ID having been scanned, without having to store the actual information in the ID
itself. Doing this, while also being open-source has not (as far as I know) been done before and represents a significant boon to both businesses who are able to verify the age of customers quickly and easily while shielding themselves from liability, as well as customers who don't have to worry about any private data being stored on company servers.
